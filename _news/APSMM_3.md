Attended my first APS Global Summit in Anaheim and gave a talk titled [Non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model](https://summit.aps.org/events/MAR-Q69/6). This work was done in collaboration with [Arijit Haldar](http://people.bose.res.in/faculty/fac_new/arijit.haldar.html) and my master's thesis advisor [Sumilan Banerjee](https://sumilanbanerjee.wixsite.com/mysite).
